## This is a fork of BL Led Controller, originally created by [DutchDeveloper](https://dutchdevelop.com/

I am going to make use of the additional PINs provided on the board.

I am going to connect
* a switch to turn on white light
* a button to cycle through all colors

Let's see how this works.

##Additional PINs

The labeling of these PINs is off. Here is the correct usage:
| GND  | GPIO 17 | GPIO 16|
| 5V  | GPIO 4 | GPIO 2|
